
## Overview
Sattu's Lunch event calender built with plain JS , HTML and CSS. 

## Thought Process

1: Came up with an algorithm such that no lunch events should overlap if they collide in time.

2: Wrote the logic for adding titles and color for each event.

3: Further added the UI part(HTML+CSS) and test.js file to test.

## Usage
open index.html

run matchLunchEvent(<List of lunch events>)
